# Contributing to Open Data Week 2018 Open Call for Submissions

>Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project :tada:! 


>In NYC we say that NYC Open Data is for All. You can learn more about NYC's Open Data Program at: www.nyc.gov/opendata

NYC Open Data is a platform run by the City of New York containing nearly 2,000 data assets published by City Agencies - from street tree data, to 311 service requests to traffic speeds - we’re putting information on how the City runs back in the hands of New Yorkers. Visit it at www.nyc.gov/opendata. To raise awareness about this resource the NYC Open Data Team partnered with the civic technology community to produce Open Data Week 2017 which engaged over 900 New Yorkers! We’re now asking for submissions of ideas for Open Data Week 2018 and hope we'll get lots of new ideas. What I'd love help with is having folks propose edits to the copy and drop-downs in the submission form - I want to make sure this is a useful open process and tool!

## How to submit changes

I am looking for edits to the copy in the submission form (a google form) for the Open Data Week 2018 Open Submissions process. The live google form is here: bit.ly/ODW18 . The copy for the form is in a file in the repo for this project.

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
