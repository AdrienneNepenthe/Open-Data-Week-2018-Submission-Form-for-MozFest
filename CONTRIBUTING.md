## How to submit changes

Explain how you want contributors to propose changes. For an example GitHub workflow, see Node.js's [instructions for code contributions](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions).

## How to report bugs

Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 

Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
